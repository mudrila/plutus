# Plutus

Welcome to Plutus! 
This is a playground intended to grow into application for control over personal finances.
If you feel like you wanna contribute - you're much welcome.

## Development

1. `git clone https://github.com/mudrila/plutus`
2. `cd plutus`
3. `yarn install`
4. `yarn dev`


This is pretty default [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [Material UI](https://mui.com/) application.
Data storage is handled completely on the client-side through `ReactContext` and `localStorage` (at least at this moment).
If you wish to rump up - just familiarize yourself with `Next.js` and `MUI` - and you're good to go!
